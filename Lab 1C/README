Title:	Lab 1C

Files:
	* Makefile

	* test.sh	

	* main.c
	
	* README

	* labC_benchmark.pdf

Improvements:
	* Included the option of '-std=c99' to prevent errors with make.

	* Logic for isOption() is corrected, the past version would not allow
	  for correct arguments such as 'A-Z' to be passed.

	* Switch to SIG_IGN instead of a user-made handler to ignore signals;
	  the past user-defined handler would hang the program given certain
	  signals such as a segmentation fault.

	* Corrected the verbose of '--crash' to '--abort'.

Notes/Issues:
	* Hopefully none, however there are still some cases in which dup2 will
	  report an error.  This may be perhaps a faulty use of pipes however
	  future versions should prevent this.
