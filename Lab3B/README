Title:	Lab 3B

NOTES:
	* Used Python to complete Lab3B.

	* The proper CSV files (6) should be present.

	* Use 'make' or 'make run' to execute, or 'python lab3b.py'.

	* The main program should execute in a little less than 10 seconds.

	** The longest part of my program is writing to the output file.

	* The output file is sorted by running the sort command in Makefile.

	* The command 'make clean' gets rid of lab3b_check.txt only.
