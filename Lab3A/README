Notes:
	** I attempted to use fprintf instead of dprintf.  This may cause
	   problems as I prevously had an implementation using dprintf.
	   Although I have compiled for the given disk-image on lnxsrv09
	   and there appears to be no problems with that!

	* I do not have valid stderr logs for sanity checks.

	* I was very confused as to whether the double/triple indirect entries
	  were to be printed.  However, the Piazza posts seemed to hint they
	  were to be left out as we should match the sample CSV files.
	  Therefore I have my implementation not report double/triple indirect
	  entries; the code for it is commented out!
