Notes:
	* I did NOT do the extra-credit DISP command.

	* Testing was done on my native machine and using openconnect VPN.

	* It was not possible for me to test with a clean Edison because I am
	  currently using the device for my capstone course.

	* My implementation of part 2 uses sockets whereas part 3 makes use of
	  BIO.

	* There are 3 C-files: part1_main.c, part2_main.c, part3_main.c.

	* Along with 3 corresponding log files: part1_log.txt, part2_log.txt,
	  part3_log.txt.

	* Using 

	* There was one time in which I encountered multiple messages received
	  in a single read, my program stalled afterwards.  However, I was not
	  able to recreate this error, and this is possibly something with
	  using openconnect to VPN to the school's network.

Files:
	* README

	* Makefile
		make 		Compiles all C-files.

		make default	Same as **above**.

		make part1 	Compiles part 1.
		
		make part2 	Compiles part 2.
		
		make part3 	Compiles part 3.

		make run1 	Runs part 1, if not yet compiled then compiles
				& runs part 1.

		make run2 	Runs part 2, if not yet compiled then compiles
				& runs part 2.

		make run3 	Runs part 3, if not yet compiled then compiles
				& runs part 3.
		
		make clean	Removes all compiled files and log files.
		
		make tarball	Packages necessary files into tarball.

	* part1_main.c
		Opens a file and writes temperature values to it in the form:
		[TIME STAMP] [TEMP]
		
		Runs indefinitely.

	* part2_main.c
		Hardcoded to be run with r01.cs.ucla.edu (port 16000).

		The program will read commands from the server and write its
		temperature readings to the server (also the terminal and log).

	* part3_main.c
		Hardcoded to be run with r01.cs.ucla.edu (port 17000).

		The program will read commands from the server and write its
		temperature readings to the server (also the terminal and log).

		Uses a SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) to communicate with the
		server.

	* log2.txt
		Log file from a test run with the remote server.

	* log3.txt
		Log file from a test run with the secure remote server.
