Files:
	* Makefile

	* test.sh	

	* main.c
	
	* README

Improvements:
	* The command 'make check' runs 'test.sh' file.

Notes/Issues:
	* The structure to hold processes assumes a MAXIMUM of 100 arguments.

	* Some mistakes in syntax such as '- --close 1' is ignored and will 
	  still run properly.

	* SIG_IGN -- the built in function for ignoring signals -- does not
	  ignore SIGKILL, I have made a separate ignore handler however it may
	  cause problems when running into various signals which are handled by
	  SIG_IGN properly.

	* I do not check for validity of arguments, placing an option such as
	  '--catch cs111' may cause problems for the code resulting in
	  undefined behavior.

	* There was a minor error in outputting the command for f_openfile()
	  with the verbose option.  However a switch in the statements made the
	  difference in what was displayed, although this is FIXED I am unsure
	  what causes the wrong output when checking for O_RDONLY first instead
	  of O_WRONLY.
